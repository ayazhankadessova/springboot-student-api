'JPA', Java SpringBoot', 'Postgresql'

## Motivation

In my previous experience, I worked with relational databases using JDBC, which is a Java API for interacting with databases. However, in this project, I made the decision to use Hibernate, which is an implementation of the Java Persistence API (JPA).

Hibernate simplifies the mapping of object data to the database schema using annotations. Unlike JDBC, which requires manual mapping code, Hibernate automatically handles the mapping based on the provided annotations. This approach reduces boilerplate code and enables a more object-oriented database interaction. Hibernate also offers advanced features, including caching, lazy loading, and transaction management, enhancing performance and reliability in Java applications.

## Project Overview

The Spring Boot project is an API that handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) requests for managing students. The project is structured into different layers, including the API layer, service layer, and data access layer. It utilizes various technologies such as Hibernate, JPA (Java Persistence API), and PostgreSQL as the underlying database.

### Key Components and Features:

1. **API Layer**: The API layer handles incoming HTTP requests and maps them to corresponding methods in the controller classes. It defines endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting student records.

2. **Service Layer**: The service layer contains the business logic of the application. It encapsulates the operations and rules related to managing students. The services communicate with the data access layer to perform CRUD operations.

3. **Data Access Layer**: The data access layer is responsible for interacting with the database. It utilizes Hibernate as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework and JPA for database persistence. The layer includes JPA repositories, which provide an interface to perform database operations.

4. **Hibernate and JPA**: Hibernate is used as the ORM framework to map Java objects to database tables. It simplifies database operations and provides features such as automatic schema generation, caching, and lazy loading. JPA, which is a specification for ORM in Java, is used in conjunction with Hibernate to define entities, relationships, and perform CRUD operations.

5. **PostgreSQL Database**: The project connects to a PostgreSQL database, which serves as the persistent data storage. PostgreSQL is a popular open-source relational database management system known for its reliability and compatibility with Java applications.

- Build API that will receive CRUD requested
- Service Layer
- Data Acccess Layer (connecting to any database)

## Learned

1. Spring Data JPA - abstraction on top of JPA & Hibernate -> easy to work with db.
2. Class = db
3. Hibernate -> Object -> ORM
4. JPA -> Generated queries (SQL)
5. API for CRUD operations on student records.
6. Implemented layers including API, service, and data access.
7. Utilized Hibernate and JPA for object-relational mapping.
8. Connected to a PostgreSQL database for data storage.
9. Learned to build an API, use Hibernate for mapping, and connect to databases.
10. How to package up your application and then from a jar spin up an instance that contains your application.
11. You can basically take the jar, deploy it to a server or dockerize it, do anything you want with your jar.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Project Steps & Notes

1. Spring Initializr

https://start.spring.io

- Maven Project
- Java
- 2.4.1

* Dependencies:

- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA
- PostgreSQL Driver

2. Simple API with SpringBoot

- RestController

```
@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class DemoApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
	}

	@GetMapping
	public List<String> hello() {
		return List.of("Hello", "World");
	}
}
```

- Localhost:8080

```
["Hello","World"]
```

3. Student class

The constructor is created with the specified parameters. Type ctor , and then press TAB twice. For the full list of snippets (little bits of prefabricated code) press Ctrl + K and then Ctrl + X .

- Right click -> Source Action

- [x] Generate constructors
- [x] Generate getters
- [x] Generate setters
- [x] Generate toString()
- [x] Change DemoApplication.js

```
	@GetMapping
	public List<Student> hello() {
		Student Mariyam = new Student(1L, "Mariam", "mariam.jamal@gmail.com", LocalDate.of(2000, Month.JANUARY, 23),
				21);
		return List.of(Mariyam);
	}
```

```
[{"id":1,"name":"Mariam","email":"mariam.jamal@gmail.com","dob":"2000-01-23","age":21}]
```

> Our class was converted to json object

4. API Layer

   - N-tier architecture: API Layer -> Service Layer -> Data Access Layer

   1. Remove `GetMapping` from `DemoApplication.java`
   2. Add `StudentController`

   ```
   @RestController
   @RequestMapping(path = "api/v1/student")
   public class StudentController {

   @GetMapping
   public List<Student> hello() {
   Student Mariyam = new Student(1L, "Mariam", "mariam.jamal@gmail.com", LocalDate.of(2000, Month.JANUARY, 23),
           21);
   return List.of(Mariyam);
   }
   }
   ```

   3. Test `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/student`

   ```
   [{"id":1,"name":"Mariam","email":"mariam.jamal@gmail.com","dob":"2000-01-23","age":21}]
   ```

5. Business Layer

   1. Add `StudentController` -> `StudentService`

   ```
   @RestController
   @RequestMapping(path = "api/v1/student")
   public class StudentController {

   	private final StudentService studentService;


   	public StudentController(StudentService studentService) {
   		this.studentService = studentService;
   	}

   	@GetMapping
   	public List<Student> getStudents() {
   		return studentService.getStudents();
   	}

   }
   ```

   2. Student Service

   ```
   public class StudentService {
    @GetMapping
    public List<Student> getStudents() {
        Student Mariyam = new Student(1L, "Mariam", "mariam.jamal@gmail.com", LocalDate.of(2000, Month.JANUARY, 23),
                21);
        return List.of(Mariyam);
   	}
   }
   ```

6. Annotation & Dependency injection within Spring & SpringBoot.

   1. In Controller, make `StudentService` to be auto generated -> `AutoWired`
   2. In `Service`, make it `Bean` -> Add `@Service`
   3. Test

   ```
   @Service
   public class StudentService {
    @GetMapping
    public List<Student> getStudents() {
        Student Mariyam = new Student(1L, "Mariam", "mariam.jamal@gmail.com", LocalDate.of(2000, Month.JANUARY, 23),
                21);
        return List.of(Mariyam);
   	}
   }
   ```

7. Properties Life (Data Access Layer) & Creating and Connecting to Database

   1. Add this to `application.properties`

   ```
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/student
   spring.datasource.username=
   spring.datasource.password=
   # clean statue every time we fun the application
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop
   spring.jpa.show-sql=true
   spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
   spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true
   ```

   2. Download `Postgres.app`

   - Best for MacOS: https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html

   3. Initialize & connect to database

   ```
   CREATE DATABASE student;

   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ‚ÄúStudent" TO ayazhan;
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "student" TO postgres;

   \l
   \c student
   \d
   ```

8. JPA And @Entity

```
@Entity
@Table
public class Student {
    @Id
    @SequenceGenerator(name = "student_sequence", sequenceName = "student_sequence", allocationSize = 1)
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = "student_sequence")
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String email;
    private LocalDate dob;
    private Integer age;

    public Student() {
    }
```

```
create sequence student_sequence start with 1 increment by 1
Hibernate:
    create table student (
        age integer,
        dob date,
        id bigint not null,
        email varchar(255),
        name varchar(255),
        primary key (id)
    )
```

9. Configure Database with 1 Table -> student

> Database -> Add connection -> PostgreSQL -> localhost@5342

10. JPA Repository

- Use interface inside of our service
- return things from the repository instead of static list

> JpaRepository gives us different methods

```
@Service
public class StudentService {

    private final StudentRepository studentRepository;

    // annotate constructor with auto-wired
    @Autowired
    public StudentService(StudentRepository studentRepository) {
        this.studentRepository = studentRepository;
    }

    public List<Student> getStudents() {
        return studentRepository.findAll();
    }
}
```

- Response:

```
[]
```

11. JPA Repository

```
In Spring, the objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans. A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by a Spring IoC container. Otherwise, a bean is simply one of many objects in your application. Beans, and the dependencies among them, are reflected in the configuration metadata used by a container.
```

- Hibernate is running this SQL when we do `saveAll()`: Hibernate is a Java framework that simplifies the development of Java application to interact with the database.

```
Hibernate:
    insert
    into
        student
        (age,dob,email,name,id)
    values
        (?,?,?,?,?)
```

```
[{"id":1,"name":"Mariam","email":"mariam.jamal@gmail.com","dob":"2000-01-23","age":21},{"id":2,"name":"Alex","email":"alex@gmail.com","dob":"2000-01-23","age":21}]
```

- Terminal

```
student=# SELECT * from student;
 age |    dob     | id |         email          |  name
-----+------------+----+------------------------+--------
  21 | 2000-01-23 |  1 | mariam.jamal@gmail.com | Mariam
  21 | 2000-01-23 |  2 | alex@gmail.com         | Alex
(2 rows)
```

12. Transient (Implement methods)

- Transient -> remove from DB

```
public Integer getAge() {
    return Period.between(this.dob, LocalDate.now()).getYears();
}
```

```

public Integer getAge() {
return Period.between(this.dob, LocalDate.now()).getYears();
}

```

13. Post GetMapping

> StudentController.java

- Get Payload & Store it in the system

```
ervlet        : Initializing Servlet 'dispatcherServlet'
2023-08-29T13:34:02.728+06:00  INFO 36398 --- [nio-8080-exec-2] o.s.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet        : Completed initialization in 7 ms
Student [id=null, name=null, email=bilal.ahmed@gmail.com, dob=null, age=null]

```

```
POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/student

Content-type: application/json

{
    "firstname": "Bilal",
    "lastname": "Ahmed",
    "email": "bilal.ahmed@gmail.com",
    "password": "password"
}
```

14. Writing Business Logic -> Add Student

    1. Add Query to Students

    ```
    // type of repo we want to work with
    // id
    // this interface is responsible for data access
    @Repository
    public interface StudentRepository extends JpaRepository<Student, Long> {

        @Query("SELECT * FROM Student where email=?1")
        Optional<Student> findStudentByEmail(String email);

    }
    ```

    2. Use it in `StudentService`

    ```
        public void addNewStudent(Student student) {
        Optional<Student> studentOptional = studentRepository.findStudentByEmail(student.getEmail());
        System.out.println(studentOptional);

        if (studentOptional.isPresent()) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("email taken.")
        }

        studentRepository.save(student);
    }
    ```

15. Testing POST Request

        1. POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/student

        > Content-type: application/json

        ```
        {
        "name": "Yerkezhan",
        "email": "yerkezhan.kadessova@gmail.com",
        "dob": "1995-12-17"
        }
        ```

        2. Success! -> Added to dob

        ```
        [{"id":1,"name":"Mariam","email":"mariam.jamal@gmail.com","dob":"2000-01-23","age":23},{"id":2,"name":"Alex","email":"alex@gmail.com","dob":"2002-01-23","age":21},{"id":3,"name":"Yerkezhan","email":"yerkezhan.kadessova@gmail.com","dob":"1995-12-17","age":27}]
        ```

        3. Include message that we added in our Exception

        ```
        {
        "timestamp": "2023-08-30T07:41:50.988+00:00",
        "status": 500,
        "error": "Internal Server Error",
        "message": "email taken.",
        "path": "/api/v1/student"
        }
        ```

16. Adding DELETE Request

    1. DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/v1/student/1
    2. Add the `DELETE` Mapping in the controller using annotation
    3. Add `DelById` in Student Service

17. Add PUT Method

    - COntroller -> Service (Transactional)

    1. Pass id in path, pass name & email in parameters ( not required)
    2. Check if student exists
    3. Check name (check if name length >0, if not same name)
    4. Check email (check if email length >0, if not same email as someones & old)

    5. Test PUT

    - PUT http://localhost:8080/api/v1/student/1?name=Ayazhik
    - Will Change to:

    ```
    [{"id":2,"name":"Alex","email":"alex@gmail.com","dob":"2002-01-23","age":21},{"id":1,"name":"Ayazhik","email":"mariam.jamal@gmail.com","dob":"2000-01-23","age":23}]
    ```

    - Same email:

    ````
    {
    "timestamp": "2023-08-30T09:36:56.177+00:00",
    "status": 500,
    "error": "Internal Server Error",
    "message": "This email is taken.",
    "path": "/api/v1/student/1"
    }```
    ````

18. TODO: Testing

- [ ] Unit Testing
- [ ] Integration Testing
- [ ] Test Driven Development
- [ ] Stripe: Test Against External Services

20. Packaging & running

_How to take API, produce a .jar that we can then run multiple instances of our application._

    1. Delete `target` folder
    - [ ] Make sure you have Maven installed or the next steps will fail
    2. mvn -N wrapper:wrapper
    3. maven clean
    4. maven install -> install application & ensure it is up and running
    (it will clean, validate, compile, test, package, verify).
    5. Inside, we are going to have .jar file, which we can then run manually.
    6. Green tick -> target folder

    ```
    [INFO] Installing /Users/ayazhan/Documents/GitHub/springboot-java/target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar to /Users/ayazhan/.m2/repository/com/example/demo/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
    [INFO] ------------------
    ```
    7. Inside the target folder, we have demo-snapshot.jar
    8. Terminal:

    ```
    cd target
    java -jar demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```
    - application now is up & running
    9. Navigate to localhost
    10. So, we packaged the application into the jar & now we have run one instance.
    11. If you want to run new instance in a different port:
    ```
    java -jar demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=8081
    ```

## Notes

1. JPA Repository -> CRUD Methods for our entity
2. The `@Transactional` annotation in Java SpringBoot is used to manage transactions. It ensures that a group of database operations are treated as a single unit, providing atomicity, consistency, isolation, and concurrency control. It simplifies transaction management and promotes a declarative programming style.

> If you update email -> it should not be already taken.

3. ShortCuts

```
@GetMapping - shortcut for @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)
@PostMapping - shortcut for @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)
@PutMapping - shortcut for @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.PUT)
@DeleteMapping - shortcut for @RequestMapping(method =RequestMethod.DELETE)
@PatchMapping - shortcut for @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.PATCH)
